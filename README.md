# Expression Converter
This is my submission for CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science Principles create task. It takes an infix-notation mathematical expression and converts it to both prefix and postfix notation, as well as solves it, using a binary tree algorithm.

This program is dated spring 2017, which would be my senior year of high school.
